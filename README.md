# Arithmetic_Operators
Experiment_3

## AIM - 
To use operators to add two numbers.

## Theory
Airthmetic operators are symbols used in programming to perform operations on variables and values. They are important to writing expressions and making decisions in code.

### Types: 
Addition (+): Adds two operands.
Example: a + b
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second operand from the first.
Example: a - b
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.
Example: a * b
Division (/): Divides the numerator by the denominator.
Example: a / b
Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of a division operation.
Example: a % b

## Algorithm 

* Start
* Declare three integer variables: a, b, and c.
* Prompt and Read First Number

* Output: "Enter num 1: ".
Read the input value and store it in variable a.
Prompt and Read Second Number

* Output: "Enter num 2: ".
Read the input value and store it in variable b.
Calculate the Sum

* Compute the sum of a and b and store the result in variable c.
Output the Result

* Output the result: "The No. is: " followed by the value of c.
* End
